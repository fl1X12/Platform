this piece is to implent get and post fucntionality into the platform 

**app.js**
is the file where the functions have been called, and the url w/ endpoint has been formed based on user input
has 2 portions
1) the commented section has the code to implement the functionality using functions

**comp1.js**
is the component implementation of the get request

**getFunction.js**
is the function implementation of the get request

**comp2.js**
is the component implementation of the post request

**postFunction.js**
is the function implementation of the post request

**componentImplementation.js**
is similar to app.js but makes use of comp1 and comp2 instead of the function implementation
